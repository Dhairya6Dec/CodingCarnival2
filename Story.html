According to folk tales Hinduism Today, a king named Hiranyakashipu who, like many demons and Asuras, had the intense desire to be immortal. To fulfill this desire, he performed the required Tapas until he was granted a wish by Brahma. Since the gods rarely granted immortality, he used his guile and cunning to get a boon that he thought made him immortal. The boon gave Hiranyakashipu five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by astra (projectile weapons) nor by any shastra (handheld weapons), and neither on land nor in water or air. As this wish was granted, Hiranyakashipu felt invincible, which made him arrogant. Hiranyakashipu decreed that only he be worshiped as a god, punished and killed anyone who did not accept his orders. His son Prahlad disagreed with his father, and refused to worship his father as a god. He continued believing and worshipping Lord Vishnu.

This made Hiranyakashipu very angry and he made various attempts to kill Prahlad. During a particular attempt on Prahlad's life, King Hiranyakashipu called upon his sister Holika for help. Holika had a special cloak garment that prevented her from being harmed by fire. Hiranyakashipu asked her to sit on a bonfire with Prahlad, by tricking the boy to sit on her lap. However, as the fire roared, the garment flew from Holika and covered Prahlad. Holika burnt to death, Prahlad came out unharmed.[1][2]

Vishnu appeared in the form of Narasimha - half human and half lion, at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashipu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon). In this form, the boon of five special powers granted to Hiranyakashipu were no longer useful. Prahlad and the kingdom of human beings were thus free from the compulsion and fear of Hiranyakashipu, showing the victory of good over evil</p>

  <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.AfaUjYf4dXPgZGk5zCGWoAHaFf?w=263&h=195&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.1&pid=1.7" width="542" height="402">

</center><p style="text-align: justify;">The festival of Holi is usually associated with Lord Krishna. In places like Braj, Vrindavan and Mathura, Holi is a grand festival in which people celebrate the eternal love between Lord Krishna and his divine companion Radha. This year, it will be held from 18-19 March 2022.Lord Krishna has always been portrayed as the lovable prankster in the legends. His playful nature and his 'leela' with the women of Braj is immensely popular. More than anything else, the eternal and divine love of Krishna and Radha makes this festival all the more special. The people of the Braj and surrounding areas enact roleplays during Holi which brings to life the divine legend of Radha and Krishna.Once Lord Krishna was extremely envious of his companion Radha's complexion. Krishna was dark in colour, while Radha was very fair. So, he complained to his mother Yashoda that nature is very unjust as it had made Radha fair and him dark.
To pacify her young son, Yashoda asked Krishna to go and colour Radha's face with whatever colour he wished to. So, Lord Krishna paid heed to the advice of his mother and applied colours on Radha's face, making her look like himself. Thus, the custom of applying colours to each other on Holi is said to have begun.

This lovable prank of the Lord gained popularity as he also played this prank on other women or gopis of the village. He threw colours and teased them with jets of colourful water. Hence, the tradition of applying colours evolved and became an inseparable part of the festival.</p>

  <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.bA_hKYSeUVEmnxu-Swbd0AHaFj?w=230&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.1&pid=1.7" width="600" height="450">

</center><p style="text-align: justify;">The legend has it that when Lord Shiva's consort Sati committed herself to fire due to disgrace shown by her father Daksha to Shiva, Lord Shiva became extremely sad. He renounced his worldly duties and went into deep meditation.

Meanwhile, the daughter of the mountains, Parvati started meditating to acquire Shiva as her husband. Moreover, since Shiva was least interested in the affairs of the world complications began to generate in matters of the world which made all the gods concerned and afraid.

The gods then seeked the help of Lord Kaamadeva, the god of love and passion to bring Shiva back to his original self. Kaamadeva knew that he might have to suffer the consequences of doing this, but he accepted to shoot his arrow on Shiva for the sake of the world.

As planned Kaama shot his love arrow on Shiva while he was in meditation. This made Shiva extremely angry and he opened his third eye - reducing Kaamadeva to ashes. However, Kaamadeva arrow had the desired effect and Lord Shiva married Parvati.

A short while after this, Kaamadeva's wife, Rati pleaded Lord Shiva and said this was all the plan of the gods and asked him to to kindly revive Kaamadeva. An embodiment of love himself, Lord Shiva gladly accepted to do so.
Thus the incident had a happy ending for all</p>
