<h2>Puran Poli</h2>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.wvB7gmdfoDQSDzNF7Hp3PQHaEw?w=310&h=200&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.1&pid=1.7" width="800" height="524">
<p>Puran poli is a Maharashtrian sweet dish prepared on special occasions. It is also a popular dish prepared in states like Gujarat, Goa and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<h4>Recipe</h4>
<p>2 cups Whole Wheat Flour (for dough)
1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour (for rolling)
1/2 teaspoon  Kosher Salt
1 tablespoon  Vegetable Oil
1 cup Water (plus more as needed)
2 tablespoons Ghee
1 cup Chana Dal
5 cups  Water
1/2 cup Jaggery
1/2 cup Sugar
1/4 teaspoon  Nutmeg Powder
1/4 teaspoon  Cardamom Powder
1/4 teaspoon  Saffron (optional)</p>
<p>Rinse and drain the lentils.
Add lentils with 2.5 cups of filter water and Pressure Cook(Hi) for 10 minutes followed by natural pressure release.
Strain the liquids from the lentils using a mesh strainer and reserve the liquids.
Return the lentils to the Instant Pot. Add jaggery, sugar, nutmeg, cardamom powder, dry ginger, and saffron. Mix well and cook stirring frequently until the Puran starts to thicken up. If sautéing in the Instant Pot, cook on sauté(normal) mode to avoid splatters. 
Let the cooked lentils cool down for a few mins and then blend it to a smooth consistency in a food processor.  Make sure the lentils are not completely cold, they need to be blended while they are warm.

Step by step recipe to make Puran Poli</p>
<p><h6>Step 1</h6> - Start by making the Puran or the sweet filling:
Wash the chana daal 2-3 times. Drain all the water and then add 5 cups of filter water along with the daal in a heavy-bottomed pot. Let the daal cook on medium-low heat for at least an hour, stirring a few times.
If you see white foam rises up from the lentils, gently discard the foam with a spatula. The daal should be cooked very soft, test them by pressing between thumb and index finger and it should be very soft and mushy.
Note: Cooking time may vary, I usually let mine cook for a couple of hours on medium-low heat. If you can stay near the stove while it is cooking you may want to cook it at medium-high, stirring more frequently, in which case the daal will be fully cooked in 45 mins.

Drain all the water using a strainer (save the water to make Katachi Aamti, see recipe below). Put the daal back in the pot. Add jaggery, sugar, nutmeg, cardamom powder, dry ginger, and saffron to the lentils. Mix well, and cook stirring frequently for 20 mins on medium heat.
Let the above mixture cool down for a few mins and then blend it to a smooth consistency in a food processor.  Tip - Make sure to blend while it is warm. This is our sweet stuffing and it should have a soft consistency like the picture below.

</p><h6>Step 2</h6> - Knead the outer dough:
Knead soft dough with whole wheat flour, salt, saffron, and oil. This dough should be softer than the normal roti/paratha dough to get soft and flaky Puran Poli. Let this dough rest for at least half an hour at room temperature.</p>
<p><h6>Step 3</h6>- Rolling and cooking Poli: Make a lemon sized balls from the dough and the puran. Prehat a pan on medium-high heat.
Roll the dough by using little bit of dry wheat flour. Make a 4-5 inch diameter circle.
Put the puran ball in the middle of the rolled dough
Make pleats on the side of the dough to enclose the puran.
photos thirteen through sixteen showing how to stuff puran in the dough
Close the pleats together tightly and press down the excess dough to make a flat disc
Roll the Poli softly using some dry flour. You can roll this thin or keep it a little thicker. I roll mine thin to about 8-10 inches in diameter.

Gently put the rolled Poli on the heated pan. Cook evenly on both sides to a perfect golden brown color. Add a little ghee to both sides and cook until both sides are golden brown.

<p>Holi and Gujiya are synonymous with other. A traditional Holi-special delicacy, this sweet dish is made from thickened milk and dry fruits.</p>
<p>1 ½ cups All Purpose Flour
¼ cup Ghee
1 pinch Salt
¼ cup Lukewarm Water (+ 3 tablespoons extra, to knead the dough)
1 ½ tablespoons Ghee
¾ cup Mawa
¼ cup Unsweetend Desiccated Coconut
½ cup Powdered Sugar (+ 2 tablespoons extra, adjust to taste)
1 tablespoon  Raisins
1 ½ pieces  Slivered Almonds
1 tablespoon  Cashews
¾ tablespoon  Charoli Nuts
½ teaspoon  Cardamom Powder
½ teaspoon  Toasted Saffron Strands
add Ghee (for frying)
½ cup Sugar
4 tablespoons Water
½ teaspoon  Green Cardamom Powder
1 teaspoon  Rose Water
0.12 teaspoon Saffron Strands
</p>
<h4>Recipe</h4>
<h5>Step:1 – MAKE DOUGH FOR GUJIYA</h5>
<p>Sift flour and salt in a mixing bowl, add ghee to the bowl.  Using your fingertips, rub the flour and ghee together until the mixture resembles-like breadcrumbs. 

Slowly add lukewarm water to the flour and knead it into a firm dough. The dough should feel soft yet stiff but not sticky. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and allow it to rest for 15-20 minutes. 

This is a required step. Please do not skip through this process. The dough will become more firm as the gluten develops and flour gets hydrated, resulting in crisper gujiyas.</p>

<h5>STEP:2 – STUFFING FOR GUJIYA</h5>
<p>Add ghee to a pan, add slivered almonds, charoli nuts, cashews, and raisins. Roast them for 5-6 minutes on a low flame until fragrant. Once done, take the pan off the flame and allow them to cool. Transfer the nuts (leave the raisins) to a grinder and grind them into the fine powder. Set aside. 

Add ghee to the same pan; as it melts, add mawa/khoya and roast it for about 2-3 minutes. Once done, take it off the flame and set it aside to cool. 

Now, add coconut, powdered sugar, ground nuts, cardamom powder, and raisins to the mawa.
Mix until all the ingredients are fully incorporated. The mixture will be fine textured and should feel soft when rubbed in between fingers. Cover and set it aside to cool.

<h5>STEP:3 – SHAPING THE GUJIYAS</h5>
<p>Divide the gujiya dough into equal-sized balls. Cover the rest of the dough balls with a kitchen cloth and set them aside. 

Take one ball and roll it into a 5-inch disc. Place a tablespoon full of mawa filling in the center of the rolled-out dough. Leave the space around the edges. 

Moisten the edge of the dough with water.

How to shape Gujiya
Lift the dough’s topside and fold it all the way over the rest of the dough to cover the mawa filling, press, and seal the edges well.
 Gujiya mold – This is the easier and fastest method. Place the folded gujiya in a gujiya mold. Press the mold until the edges are pinched together, and the gujiya is sealed. Remove the excess dough from the sides.

This is the most efficient method as the pleats prevent the filling from coming out during frying. 
How to use mold
Repeat the process with the rest of the dough until all the gujiyas are shaped. 
To prevent drying, keep the shaped gujiyas covered with a kitchen cloth at all times.

<h5>STEP:4 – FRYING THE GUJIYAS</h5>
<p>Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan. Once the ghee is moderately hot, gently slide in the gujiyas and deep-fry them until golden brown and crisp. Each batch takes somewhere around 12-15 minutes of frying time. 
Once cooked, remove from ghee and set them on a kitchen paper towel.  
Fry Gujiyas in oil
Fry all the gujiyas in a similar manner.  Mawa gujiyas are ready to be served.
If you do not prefer to soak them in sugar syrup, then serve them as is garnished with edible dried rose petals and dry nuts.
Fried Gujiyas</p>
<h5>STEP:5 – SOAK THE GUJIYAS</h5>
<p>Combine sugar, water, cardamom powder, and saffron in a pan. Bring it to a boil. 
Our main purpose is to melt the sugar; we are not looking for a sugar consistency here. Therefore, cook the syrup for about 5-6 minutes on a low flame. After the desired cooking time is over, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool. 
Dip the fried gujiyas in the warm sugar syrup for a few seconds. Coat it well. Remove from sugar syrup and set aside. 
Coat the rest of the gujiyas in the sugar syrup and set them aside. Jazz them up crushed pistachios, silver leaf, edible dried rose petals, and serve.</p>

<h2>Recipe</h2>
Soaking Lentils
<h5>Step 1</h5><p>.Soak 1 cup heaped urad dal (200 grams husked and split black lentils) overnight or for at least 4 to 5 hours. Later drain all the water using a colander or strainer. If you prefer, you can rinse the soaked urad dal.</p>

Grinding Lentils
<h5>Step 2</h5> <p>Then add the drained and soaked lentils in your trusted blender or mixer-grinder.</p>

drained lentils placed in a blender
<h5>Step 3.</h5> <p>Add in 1/2 teaspoon chopped green chilies or serrano/thai chillies, 1 teaspoon chopped ginger, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing) and salt as needed.
add spices, herbs and salt to lentils in blender</p>
<h5>Step 4</h5>.<p> Blend or grind adding ¼ cup to ½ cup water in parts to a smooth fluffy batter. Depending on the quality, age of lentils and soaking time the water amount can vary from ½ to ¾ cup. Keep in mind that the batter has a thick to medium-thick flowing consistency.
Grind in two batches or one batch depending on the capacity and size of your blender or mixer-grinder.</p>
<h4>Tips</h4>
TIP 1: Adding a lot of water will make the batter thin which will result in a flat vada that absorbs more oil. A thin or runny batter will always absorb more oil while frying.
TIP 2: If the batter becomes thin or watery, add some rice flour or sooji (rava, semolina) to the batter and mix thoroughly to thicken it. Do not add too much of sooji as it can make the vada have a dense texture.
TIP 3: To check if the batter has the right consistency, place a few drops of batter in a bowl of water. The batter having the right consistency will float on top of the water surface. If the batter has become thin, it will sink or dissolve in the water.
<h5>Step 5</h5>. <p>Take the ground batter in a bowl with a help of a silicon spatula. Then briskly and vigorously whip the batter for two to three minutes with a spoon, whisk or spatula.
Whipping the batter aerates it and makes it more fluffy and light. As a result, you get softer and porous vada. A photo showing the consistency of the batter.

<h5>Step 6</h5>.<p> Stir in 1 tablespoon raisins (chopped) and 12 to 15 cashews (chopped roughly). These are optional ingredients and you can skip them if you want.
chopped raisins and cashews added to batter</p>

Checking oil temperature
<h5>Step 7</h5>.<p> Heat oil as needed for deep frying in a kadai (Indian wok) or pan. Heat oil on medium heat. The oil should reach a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees celsius.
To check without a thermometer, add some droplets of the batter with a spoon. It should sizzle and come up on the surface of oil swiftly and gradually.
If the batter droplets stay at the bottom of the pan, the oil is cold. If it comes up very quickly and becomes too browned or burnt, the oil is very hot.

Frying Vada
<h5> Step 8</h5>. <p>Once the oil has reached the correct heat or temperature, now you can either drop the batter carefully with your fingers (without touching the hot oil) or with a spoon in medium hot oil. Fry the vada in batches until crisp and golden.

I prefer to use a spoon. You can moisten the spoon with a bit of water, so that the batter slides easily from it.

Make the vada having more or less the same size. If you end up making different sizes, than the smaller sized vada will fry quickly and the larger sized vada will take more time. So do take a note of it and remove the smaller vada when they look golden and crisp all over.

Do not overcrowd the pan or kadai. Overcrowding the pan will lower the oil temperature and as a result the vadas will soak more oil. The vada also expand a bit while frying.

In the photo below, it looks as if the pan is overcrowded with the vada, but actually it is not – blame it on the macro photography!

<h5>Step 9</h5>. <p>Let the bottom side become light golden and crisp. Then only turn these or they will break in the oil.

<h5>Step 10</h5>. <p> Flip again and for a couple of times more while frying. This ensures even cooking and you should see a uniform golden color all over.

<h5>Step 11</h5>. </p> Place the vada on paper towels. This way fry the remaining vada in batches using up the entire batter. If you want use half portion of the batter, then refrigerate the batter for a couple of days or freeze it for a month.

Soaking Vada</p>
<h5>Step 12</h5> <p> Wait for 2 to 3 minutes and while they are still hot, add the vada in water (at room temperature) and let them soak for 12-15 minutes. The vada will release some of the oil and absorb water increasing a bit in size with a color change.
</p>
<h5>Step 13</h5>. <p>Press each soaked vada between your palms to remove water. Gently press or else you might end up breaking them

<h5>Step 14</h5>. <p>Press all the soaked vada this way and keep them aside in a plate or you can arrange them in the bowl or tray that you will be serving dahi vada.

Assembling the add ons for Dahi Vada
15. Beat 2.5 cups chilled curd (yogurt) until smooth. Check the taste of the curd before you assemble. The curd should not taste sour, bitter or acidic. It should be fresh with a pleasant sweet-sour taste. I suggest to use Homemade Curd.</p>

<h5>Step 16</h5>. <p>Keep your chutneys ready. Here is the photo of the spicy coriander (cilantro) chutney and this is how it is made.

Take the following listed ingredients in a small blender or mixer and blend until smooth.

2 cups coriander leaves (cilantro)
½ to 1 teaspoon amchur powder (dry mango powder)

1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic
1 teaspoon green chillies
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds or cumin powder
salt as required
2 to 3 tablespoons of water or as needed
green coriander chutney in a blender</p>
<h5>Step 18.</h5> <p>In a large serving bowl or a tray arrange the vada which you had set aside after squeezing the water.</p>
<h5> Step 19.</h5><p> Pour the beaten curd evenly all over the vada covering them completely.</p>

<h5>Step 20.<p> Pour the green coriander chutney and sweet tamarind chutney as you like.</p>

<h5>Step 21.</h5> <p>Sprinkle dahi vada with a few pinches of red chili powder or cayenne, roasted cumin powder, ¼ cup pomegranate arils (optional), chaat masala and/or black salt.

Garnish with 2 tablespoon coriander leaves and serve straightway. Or you can refrigerate for a couple of hours before serving.</p>
